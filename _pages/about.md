I am a second year PhD student in Linguistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/costanza-vallicelli). My research focuses on morphosyntactic variation in heritage languages spoken in the Greater Toronto Area, and in particular heritage Italian languages (not just Standard Italian, but also regional languages - the so called "dialects" - such as Sicilian, Calabrese, Venetan, etc.) In my research I use both quantitive and qualititve methods to explore and explain how langauge changes in multilingual societies. I am particularly interested in changes at the morphosyntax/pragmatic interface (phenomena sych as word-order, pro-drop), and how we use both corpus data analysis and experimental methods to explore this type of variation. 

I am also a Research Assistant for the [Heritage Language Variation and Change Project](https://ngn.artsci.utoronto.ca/HLVC/3_2_active_ra.php) (PI: Naomi Nagy).

**Here is a list of the topics that I’m currently working on:**
1. Possessive order variation in homeland and heritage Calabrian-Italian and loss of regional markedness in this variety as a result of standardization.
2. Language Ideologies among Heritage Calabrian-Italians, tentions between Standard Language Ideologies and Authenticity in the use of Italian vs Calabrese.
3. Language documentation of Romagnol, an endangered and under documented Romance language spoken in the North-East of Italy.


I’ll keep updating my research outputs here. Feel free to reach out!
